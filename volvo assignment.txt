                   README.md
2. Test Case File
Created the test case file that describes the "Buy the Car" scenario in the Robot Framework .

**File: tests/buy_car.robot**

*** Settings ***
Documentation    Test suite for buying a car in the web shop.
Resource         ../resources/keywords.robot
Resource         ../resources/locators.robot
Suite Setup      Open Browser To Home Page

${IMPLICIT_WAIT}    10

*** Keywords ***
Open Browser To Home Page
    Open Browser    ${URL}    ${BROWSER}
    Maximize Browser Window
    Set Selenium Implicit Wait    ${IMPLICIT_WAIT}

Search For A Car
    [Arguments]    ${car_name}
    Input Text    search_box    ${car_name}
    Click Button    search_button

Select First Car From Results
    Click Element    first_result

Add Car To Cart
    Click Button    add_to_cart_button

Go To Cart
    Click Element    view_cart_button

Verify Car In Cart
    [Arguments]    ${car_name}
    Element Text Should Be    cart_item    ${car_name}

Proceed To Checkout
    Click Button    checkout_button

Verify Checkout Confirmation
    Page Should Contain    Order Confirmation
4. Locators
Define the locators for the web elements in a separate file to keep the keywords clean and maintainable.

File: resources/locators.robot

*** Variables ***
${search_box}            id=search
${search_button}         css=.search-btn
${first_result}          css=.product-item
${add_to_cart_button}    id=add-to-cart
${view_cart_button}      id=view-cart
${cart_item}             css=.cart-item
${checkout_button}       id=checkout
5. Running the Tests
**To run the tests using the Robot Framework, using the following command**
robot -d reports tests/buy_car.robot
**This command runs the test suite and generates a report in the reports/ directory**

6. Dockerization 
To run these tests in a Docker container, create a Dockerfile.
File: Dockerfile
**dockerfile**

RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
CMD ["robot", "-d", "reports", "tests/buy_car.robot"]
**Build and run the Docker container**
docker build -t web_shop_robot .
docker run -v $(pwd)/reports:/app/reports web_shop_robot
**Reporting**
The Robot Framework automatically generates HTML and XML reports. The HTML report (report.html) and log (log.html) files are located in the reports/ directory.

8. Requirements File
Include all necessary dependencies in the requirements.txt file.

**File: requirements.txt**
robotframework==6.0
robotframework-seleniumlibrary==6.0
9. Documentation
Add a README.md file to explain how to set up and run the tests.

File: README.md
##Web Shop Robot Framework Tests
## Setup

1. Install the dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Run the tests:
robot -d reports tests/buy_car.robot

3. To run the tests in Docker:
docker build -t web_shop_robot .
docker run -v $(pwd)/reports:/app/reports web_shop_robot


**Reports**
The test reports will be available in the `reports/` directory after running the tests.
This setup provides a structured and maintainable way to test the "Buy the Car" scenario in a web shop using the Robot Framework, ensuring that the tests are clear and easily understandable by stakeholders.
